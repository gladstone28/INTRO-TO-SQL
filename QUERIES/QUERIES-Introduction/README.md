### QUERIES

#### Introduction

In this lesson, we will be learning different SQL commands to query a single table in a database.

One of the core purposes of the SQL language is to retrieve information stored in a database. This is commonly referred to as querying. Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and returning a result set with data relevant to the question.

We will be querying a database with one table named movies.

Let’s get started!

Fun fact: IBM started out SQL as SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry Language) in the 1970’s to query databases.
